# Pokedex App

https://ioannis-sporidis.github.io/pokedex_app/

## Next steps:

- Fix bug: When the page first loads should go to the pokedex selection (React Router implementation?).
- Add more pokedexes (from various regions like Kanto pokedex, Alola pokedex etc.).
- Improve individual pokemon page appearance (Pokemon card).
- Store favorite pokemons in local storage or database.
- Maybe have background music?
